    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g of curd</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of 35% heavy cream</li>
        <li>10 tsp of sugar</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp of vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>300g of chocolate</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whip the heavy cream with sugar until soft, then add the vanilla sugar and beat again. Mix in the curd.</li>
        <li>Line a sieve with double cheesecloth, put the curd mixture on top and let the curd drain overnight.</li>
        <li>The next day, melt and temper the chocolate.</li>
        <li>Take a mini muffin pan and brush the bottoms and sides of the holes in the pan with melted chocolate. Put the mold in the freezer for a minute to harden the chocolate.</li>
        <li>Then fill the "chocolate holes" with curd mixture (e.g. use a piping bag, because it's convenient, but you can also do it successfully with the help of a spoon).</li>
        <li>Finally, cover the top of the cookies with melted chocolate. Place the mold in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>When the curds have hardened sufficiently, remove them from the mold.</li>
    </ol>
